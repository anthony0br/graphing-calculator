My A-Level Computer Science NEA, a graphing calculator in C#/Unity. This repository contains all files in the "Assets/Scripts/" directory of the Unity project.

Future improvements/optimisations to make:
- Rewrite FormulaTree using the Shunting Yard Algorithm, rather than the current recursive algorithm - convert the infix expression to RPN using a stack and output queue and use a stack to compute the output.
- Use tokenisation and/or enums to allow the support of multi-character operators/functions and ability to quickly add new functions with a given precedence.

To do: summarise parts of write-up, the evaluation and explain the project.
